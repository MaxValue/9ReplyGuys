## Typical Comments
* I would have shouted "NO" and kicked his butt! It's easy!
* Dress more like a scientist & men won't be tempted
* Now you know that was a bad mentor/lab/dept. What a great learning experience for you
* Choose your battles. Tough it out, focus on the science and you'll be fine
* Why didn't you speak out at the time?
* You go girl! The future is female! Good luck with that

## The Problem
Demands solutions from the victims.

## Warning!
You may also hear this from women.

## Typical Comments
* How rude! Now me must postpone all discussion of your experiences until you can make me feel comfortable
* You seem upset. Perhaps you aren't able to handle rational discourse
* If you get angry, they win
* The mouth on you! No wonder u got harassed
* Name calling is hardly productive, madam

Male comfort is priority #1

## Warning!
Will call you a bitch eventually

What‚Äôs the big deal anyway?

## Typical Comments
* Something similar happened to a man once, therefore you didn't experience sexism
* His INTENTIONS were good. It's a compliment
* He never assaulted women in front of me!
* I need to know the exact context or I'll assume you've blown this out of proportion
* He's just an old-school gentleman from a different culture with a hands-on mentoring style
* Sexism is just an old man problem. When they all retire everything will be better!
* If sexism was *that* common I would have noticed
* And by the way, she's no saint either

## The Problem
It's not that bad. And if it is, you deserve it

## Warning!
He's already decided to ignore your response

## What he actually should do
