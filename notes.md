* You go girl! The future is female! Good luck with that

What‚Äôs the big deal anyway?

## Typical Comments
* Something similar happened to a man once, therefore you didn't experience sexism
* His INTENTIONS were good. It's a compliment
* He never assaulted women in front of me!
* I need to know the exact context or I'll assume you've blown this out of proportion
* He's just an old-school gentleman from a different culture with a hands-on mentoring style
* Sexism is just an old man problem. When they all retire everything will be better!
* If sexism was *that* common I would have noticed
* And by the way, she's no saint either

## The Problem
It's not that bad. And if it is, you deserve it

## Warning!
He's already decided to ignore your response

## What he actually should do

Also known as "#notallmen", "I Love Women" or "Mommy Look!".

He's such a nice guy.

(He might actually be a nice guy, which makes it hard to call this out. So here's a tweet to help.)

## Typical Comments

# [Himpathy](https://twitter.com/sbarolo/status/1038128825215987712)
Also known as "Witch Hunt", "Whatabout" or "Oh the huMANity".

He's worried that with all this talk about #MeToo we're losing sight of the real victims: him and his friends.

## Typical Comments
* Too many profs are being fired due to unsubstantiated rumors with no due process!! No I can't NAME any
* If we start holding men responsible for their actions, where will it end?
* She's just claiming harassment to get ahead, and he is suffering for it
* We can't start protecting women until you can prove that nothing bad will ever happen to a man EVER
* I'm afraid to work with women now :(
* He is really going through a lot, the rules are changing, it's hard out there
* Censorship! Why can't I say whatever comes into my mind while everyone walks on eggshells around me
* If you keep this up, men will stop hitting on women at work and the human race will go extinct

## The Problem
Only men are real to him

## Warning!
Dangerous when cornered

# [The Sealion](https://twitter.com/sbarolo/status/1038524364881317890)
Also known as "Just Asking Questions (JAQass)" or "Data Dude".

Hey, he's just asking questions.

## Typical Comments
* Would you answer my endless bad-faith questions, which I could easily google on my own, with a little less attitude please?
* If you don't respond to me, you're admitting I'm right. If you DO respond to me, this never ends
* Pics or it didn't happen. Statistics or it didn't happen. Your testimony is unreliable solely because you are female.
* Why won't you repeat all the details of your painful harassment story on demand and post all the evidence?
* Is there even evidence that harrassment exists? I mean numbers, not some ANECDOTE
* The burden is on you to waste time disproving my wild unsupported claims. Then I'll deny I ever said it. Ready?

## The Problem
Data won't convince him anyway

## Warning!
Only wants to exhaust you & get the last word

## What he actually should do
* Stop replying, start listening

# [The Mansplainer](https://twitter.com/sbarolo/status/1038896351231258626)
Also known as "Well Actually", "You're Welcome" or "It Is Known".

The internet is about sharing information, whether you want it or not.

## Typical Comments
* Ah, I see you are interested in X, [person who has studied X for 20 years]! I have researched it all morning and it's more complex than you'd think. For instance did you know
* No you didn't technically ask for advice, but a woman stating a fact is a cry for help
* Your ideas were debunked years ago by a guy named... I think it starts with an F? Look it up, dummy
* I notice you wear makeup. I thought you said you were a feminist. True feminism, you see [is wrong for 5 tweets]
* There are many common misconceptions about what actually constitutes 'mansplaining'
* I have something better than a degree in your field: a truly logical mind. Weep as I shatter your paradigms

## The Problem
He's just a soul whose intentions are good

## Warning!
Oh lord, please don't let him be misunderstood

## What he actually should do
* Stop replying, start listening
