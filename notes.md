Whatever issues you are discussing, he knows that your attitude is the real problem here!

## Typical Comments
* I would have shouted "NO" and kicked his butt! It's easy!
* Dress more like a scientist & men won't be tempted
* Now you know that was a bad mentor/lab/dept. What a great learning experience for you
* Choose your battles. Tough it out, focus on the science and you'll be fine
* Why didn't you speak out at the time?
* You go girl! The future is female! Good luck with that

## The Problem
Demands solutions from the victims.

## Warning!
You may also hear this from women.

## What he actually should do

## Typical Comments
* How rude! Now me must postpone all discussion of your experiences until you can make me feel comfortable
* You seem upset. Perhaps you aren't able to handle rational discourse
* If you get angry, they win
* The mouth on you! No wonder u got harassed
* Name calling is hardly productive, madam
* Piling on this guy isn't helpful. I bet he learned his lesson and was probably misunderstood
* Such nasty vitriol! All I did was calmly point out that women are irrational & unfit to do science

## The Problem
Male comfort is priority #1

## Warning!
Will call you a bitch eventually

## What he actually should do
* Stop replying, start listening
